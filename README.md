# Inner Healing, an anxiety centered website

#Made during my time in Codepath's WEB101 course and added more touches to it.

#It is meant to spread awareness and give help to those who need it
#I wanted to do this mainly because I feel anxiety is so generalized and can be easily misunderstood at times.
