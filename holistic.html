  <div class="arrange-services">
    <h4> Herbs:</h4>
    <p> Herbs are a risk free way to aid in anxiety relief and is often done sometimes even without anxiety. </p>
    <p>- Chamonmile tea, a common aid for sleep that also helps with generalized anxiety.</p>
    <p>- Ashwagandha is also said to aid anxiety by reducing cortisol levels as well as boosting energy and contains anti-inflamatory properties. (Though it is said that it can have an impact on the kidneys and thyroid by stimulating testotorone and too much thyroid hormones, so be careful)</p>
    <p>- Kava Kava, a herb that reduces anxiety stemming from the ingredient "kavalactones" in it and can help with anxiety-related sleep. (use in moderation as it's said it can cause liver injury and can cause side effects)</p>
    <p>- Valerian Root, like many of the other helpful herbs here it contains low amounts of GABA, an amino acid that produces a calming effect on the brain and nervous system, relieving stress, anxiety, insomnia, and high blood pressure (xanax also has this but is habit forming which is why they shouldn't be taken together) The Valernic acidin it also help to regulate the amount of GABA available and increase GABA overall and have been even compared to anti-anxiety medications for its effectiveness. </p>
    <br>
    <p>(Additional herbs include: Passionflower which is commonly in teas, Lavender, a popular choice,and Lemon balm, commonly found in lotions and teas and has in addition to calming effect is aiding with cold sores.)</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Exercise:</h4>
    <p>Exercise is often the first piece of advice when it comes to anxiety/stress relief and for good reason. Plenty of studies verify that exercsie can increase brain sensitivity to chemicals like serotonin and bring in endorphins which help relieve pain and feelings of stress. </p>
    <p>- Yoga, a calming type of exercise that is reliant on stretching and holding poses with its goal to self discover with its mediative practices. In my experience, it's the perfect thing to relieve muscle tension and feelings of anxiety. It's a peaceful and soothing way to exercise your muscle and low intensity.</p>
    <p>- Running, an exercise that seems contradictory to the nature of anxiety yet is effective to relieving its symptoms. Even just 10-15 mins. of running can lead to considerable reduction in anxiety. Plus the fresh air and effects of nature help this reduction more in addition to the repeative actions of the action. It can serve as a way to keep oneself calm and focus on other things that are less anxiety inducing but keep in mind, you know your body best so choose what you think is best.</p>
    <br>
   <h4>Miscellaneous:</h4>
   <p>- Aromatherapy, commonly done in spas with items like oils and candles putting essental oils inside. Predating thousands back in China and India, essential oils like lavender, peppermint, and tea tree still persist to this day. There are claims that it manages pain, boost immunity, and of course, releases anxiety.</p>
   <p>- Weighted blankets, a popular accessory to help those with stress or anxiety by providing deep pressure stimulation which has been used by therapists in the past for the same reasons, bringing people out of their mind to focus on the sensation. However, it's up to the individual if it works for them as it may feel restrictive or realxing depending on the person.</p>
    <p>- Meditation, practicing mindfulness or breathing techniques, you activate the body's relaxation response lowering cortisol but also gives you a space to confront any underlying emotions that may be affecting you subconsciously. It is common for anxiety sufferers to find it hard to start or continue the practice, but it's important to let any thoughts that come to let them linger and go as they please.</p>
