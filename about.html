   <!--My story and the reason I made this site-->
   <p>Hello!</p>
   <br>
   <p>
    I created this website with the intent to spread more awareness on anxiety disorder after experiencing it first myself in 2023 with my first panic attack.</p>
    <br>
   <p>Which caused an intense awareness of my physical health and sensations, which many say caused health anxiety like it did for me. Plenty of people think the symptoms felt are made up that's simply not the case. Health anxiety, a type of anxiety disorder can create these psychosomatic symptoms in an attempt to protect oneself. More is elaborated in holistic methods. Regardless, it can be a very isolating experience and I don't want that for others.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p> Anxiety can easily spiral out of control, and yet for that reason is a guess as to why it's the most common mental health disorder in America. So, it's vital to be aware of what it can look like because it can be easily hidden.</p>  
   <br>
   <p>I hope what I can share here can help you in some capacity either by validating your experience or by enhancing your understanding.</p>
